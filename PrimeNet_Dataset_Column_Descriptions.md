Column Descriptions:

Validly_Edited: Represents the proportion or count of sequences that have been correctly edited.
Unedited: Indicates the proportion or count of sequences that remain unedited.
Erroneously_Edited: Shows the proportion or count of sequences that have been edited incorrectly.
wide_initial_target: Contains the DNA sequence for the initial target prior to any editing.
wide_mutated_target: Contains the DNA sequence for the target after mutation.
uniqueindex: A unique identifier for each record in the dataset.
initial_dnase: Represents the DNase accessibility states for the initial target sequence (typically marked as 'Y' for accessible and 'N' for not accessible).
initial_methylation: Indicates the methylation status of the initial target, using characters like 'Y' (methylated) or 'N' (unmethylated).
mutated_dnase: Represents the DNase accessibility states for the mutated target sequence.
mutated_methylation: Indicates the methylation status of the mutated target.
protospacerlocation_only_initial: Provides the location range (formatted as a string list, e.g., "[10, 29]") of the protospacer in the initial target sequence.
PBSlocation: Indicates the location range of the Primer Binding Site (PBS) in the mutated sequence.
RT_initial_location: Denotes the location range of the reverse transcriptase (RT) initial region in the initial sequence.
RT_mutated_location: Denotes the location range of the reverse transcriptase (RT) mutated region in the mutated sequence.
